# Installation

Just install the module using npm.

```bash
$ npm install aws-launcher
```

Drag and drop the generated folder (located in your `home` directory) in your
macOS Dock right by the Trash Item.

# Customization

By default, `aws-launcher` generates shortcuts for all AWS services.
You can customize your launcher folder by deleting files in the `aws-launcher` 
folder.
You will need to drag and drop the folder again in your macOS dock to see your 
updated launcher.

# Spotlight

Since `aws-launcher` is basically just a folder, you can use the macOS spotlight 
to use your shortcuts as well.
